        <h1>Our Concept Statement</h1>
        <p>McKeldin Library is a university resource that we want to improve for our clients and end users; students attending the University of Maryland College Park. Although this landmark library is used by other groups, the optimization of this space affects the over success and satisfaction of current students. We will gather data that will help us to reestablish McKeldin Library as the premier study location on campus and show students that libraries are still a valuable part of any community. The mission of this project is to maximize the usability of McKeldin Library with the creation of an application. This application will help students better navigate McKeldin by allowing them to plan ahead and find spaces or resources that suit their needs. The application will also provide more information for persons with disabilities. We believe having information in one centralized location, such as an application, will help to maximize the user's experience with McKeldin Library. This application will strive to meet all user needs within one central location. We also want this application to give the users a personal tie with McKeldin as the app requires them to have their own account. We hope that this personal link within the application will cause the users to have more of an emotional tie to McKeldin.</p>
