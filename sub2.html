               <h1>Project 2: Contextual Analysis</h1>
               <h2>Project Topic: Updated for Submission 2</h2>
               <p align = left>The topic that has been selected for this project is McKeldin Library. We will be examining the different ways in which the library could be altered to make it a more ideal study location for students. These changes will be both physical and technical. They will allow students more resources but also more comfort as well. This project pertains to more than just the resources the library has to offer, it also pertains to the physical aspects of the environment. There are aspects in both of these categories that the library could improve upon to become a more enticing study location for students. The goal of this project is to maximize the use and usability of the library by students, so that they once again come to realize how beneficial libraries can be. </p>
               <h2>WAAD</h2>
               <img src = 'images/waad.png' alt = "waad diagram" width="700" height="600">
               <p align = left>Completing this WAAD gave us insights into the ways in which McKeldin was useful and how it could be improved. By laying out the responses we gathered in a physical space and categorizing them we were able to notice patterns.</p>
               <h2>Flow Model</h2>
               <img src = 'images/flow.png' alt = "flow model" width="700" height="600">
               <p align = left>We included work roles in our diagram which are undergraduates, graduates, faculty, and student groups. The reason why we separated undergraduates and graduates is because the library separates resources for these two groups by floor. The we drew connections based on how the machine roles are used by the work roles. </p>
