        <h1>Project 4 Part 1: Personas and Sketches</h1>
        <h1>Personas</h1>
        <p>Personas are created in order to think of types of people that are going to use your final UX product. Most of our personas relate to students due to the groups of people we have interviewed and interacted with in the course of this project. We also developed these personas from different departments because our interviewees were a diverse group of students from different majors. While creating our personas we followed some of the guidelines given to us in IRLA10. This includes avoiding implicit bias by using diverse pictures and creating rich stories without the unconscious attribution of traits to certain groups. </p>
        <h1>Sketches</h1>
        <p>Below are some rough sketches for our McKeldin Library application:</p>
