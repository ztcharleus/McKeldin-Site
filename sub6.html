        <h1>Project 6: Evaluation</h1>
        <h2>Study Objectives</h2>
        <p>List out the key objectives or goals of your usability study (e.g., identify user pain points, assess
            ease of use):</p>
        <p>The objective of this study is to receive feedback on the usability of this application and the
            information present. We want to know if users feel that all necessary information is available, if
            the way in which the information is stored makes sense and if there is any other information
            they would like to see included.</p>
        <h2>Study Protocol: Introduction</h2>
        <p>Write a small introduction (1-2 sentences) to welcome the user to testing your application:</p>
        <p>Today you will be testing an application for the McKeldin Library on the UMD campus. This
            application strives to contain all information that a user of the library would need to maximize
            their experience. Thank you for testing our application for us!</p>
        <h2>Study Protocol: Study Tasks</h2>
        <p>List out 3 tasks (and the respective success criteria), you would use to test your prototype:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Can you locate the hours for the Library Services Desk?</li>
        <li>Can you locate the hours for the Library Services Desk?</li>
        <li>Can you find all the floors that have windows?</li>
       </ol>
