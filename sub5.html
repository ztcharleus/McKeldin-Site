        <h1>UX Evaluation</h1>
        <p>We have elected to use the Summative UX evaluation method. We feel that we need more user feedback to understand if our application offers all the features or information a user would like to see in our system. We also feel that this would allow us to detect any flaws. Earlier this week in our IRLA 12, we discovered two different problems with the application due to user feedback: the fact that there is not a way to navigate back to the home page and we need to decide what the search bar capabilities are.  In order to evaluate our application we will send out questionnaires that will require persons to first tell us what they would expect to see in an informational application for UMD libraries, we will then have them look at our designs and tell us how it measures up to their expectations. We will ask them for feedback on the design and if there is any information they feel is unnecessary. Ideally we would like to receive feedback from 5-10 people.</p>
