               <h1>Project 1: Contextual Inquiry</h1>
               <h2>Project Topic</h2>
               <p align = left>This project will pertain to McKeldin Library and what features can be added to improve it as a study location for students. There are many features that could be updated, changed or added to optimize the environment for student work. The goal of this project is to develop reasonable suggestions that will allow McKeldin to truly be known as a great study location on campus and re-establish its reputation as the best library on campus. The main stakeholders concerning this project are students, and they will be the people interviewed throughout this process.</p>
               <h2>Questions and Process</h2>
              <ol>
                   <li>Where on campus do you study most often?</li>
                   <li>Why do you use that location more often than others?</li>
                   <li>What resources do you feel are most important when selecting a study location?</li>
                   <li>How often do you use McKeldin Library over the course of a semester?</li>
                   <li>During a visit to McKeldin Library, how long do you stay in one spot to study before you have to move due to an inconvenience? (Laptop Battery, Slow Internet, Uncomfortable Seating, etc.)</li>
                   <li>What would you like to see implemented in McKeldin Library to make it an optimal learning environment?</li>
               </ol>
               <p align = left>After speaking with the TA we elected to send out a Google form to people, instead of interrupting them in their work. We got a total of 11 responses which we felt was a decent number.</p>
               <p align = left>We also visited Mckeldin Library twice and each visit we observed for two hours. We each took separate notes and compiled about 14 pages together, 7 each.</p>
